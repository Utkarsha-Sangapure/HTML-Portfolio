<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Utkarsha Sangapure, a dedicated professional with a strong foundation in computer science. 
  Originally from Maharashtra, India, I currently reside in the vibrant city of Solapur. I hold a Bachelor's degree with a
  specialization in computer science from Sangmeshwar College, Solapur. Building upon this foundation, I pursued and 
  successfully completed my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) from Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Solapur University.</p>
  <p>My academic journey has been complemented by a proactive pursuit of knowledge in various technologies, including
     Oracle, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I am further enhancing my skill set by studying ReactJS, demonstrating
      my commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements.
  </p>
  <p>One of the highlights of my academic and professional journey is the development of the Wholesale Gold Management
       System during my final year project. This experience not only allowed me to apply and refine my technical skills 
       but also unveiled my innate ability to thrive as a team player.
  </p>
  <p>Outside the realm of technology, I find inspiration and a sense of balance through my passion for Mandala art. 
    Drawing these spiritual symbols from Asian art during work breaks has not only shown me determination but has also
     fueled my creativity.
  </p>
  <p>Eager to contribute my passion and skills to an innovative company, I am confident in my ability to make a positive
     impact. I believe in the power of collaboration and am excited about the prospect of being part of a forward-thinking
      team. That, in essence, is a snapshot of who I am â€“ a tech enthusiast, a team player, and a creative spirit ready to
       embark on new challenges.</p>
